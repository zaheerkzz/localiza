# localiza

Hello, I need to scrap data from www.localiza.com.br, which is a brazilian car rental company website. The objective is to pass any parameters (store location, start date/time, end date/time) and retrieve all prices for all carÂ´s models daily rental fares. The data can be storage on a local CSV file
You can use also use API/request directly, their API url is: https://canaisdigitais-api.localiza.com/al-canaisdigitais-site/v1/Cotacoes/melhoresofertas or https://canaisdigitais-api.localiza.com/al-canaisdigitais-site/v1/Cotacoes. I dont have API documentation.
You can build a simply python script code that I can run on my local PC.
